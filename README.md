# Journal

## Models

### Entry
- title
- content
- date (created_at)
- *categories* (leave for future)

## Challenge
1. Create a journal app with the above model. You are not allowed to use the `scaffold` generator. However, you can generate `model`s and `controller`s.
2. Do your routes manually, without using the `resources` method.
3. Add the read routes (`/entries` and `/entries/:id`).
4. (Advanced) Add the create routes (`get /entries/new` and `post /entries`).
5. (Advanced) Add the edit & delete routes (`get /entries/:id/edit`, `put /entries/:id` and `delete /entries/:id`).
